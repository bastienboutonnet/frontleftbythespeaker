Jumping from one shared obsession to another, this show will yoink, sploink and occasionally wub. Strap in, 'cause even we don't know where we're going.

**About fangs:**
The love child of acid breaks and a weird obsession for chrome teeth, fangs doesn't focus on one genre for long. Embrace surprise and stay on your feet, there's never a dull moment with fangs.

**About NEEDA VEEZA:**
NEEDA VEEZA's sets are characterized by a blend of bangers, slappers, rollers, chuggers and the occasional chunter. He usually finds a way to get the crowd going but don't be surprised when he drops some Gregorian chanting and absolutely clears the dancefloor.
