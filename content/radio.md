### 19:00 - 20:30: Protect The Bubble w/ [Accuraat](https://www.instagram.com/accuraat_crisp_sandwich/)
Amsterdamâ€™s Accuraat delves deep into the delicate intricacies of sound and rhythm, taking listeners on adventures rich with curiosity. In their universe, genres fade into obscurity. While the essence often resonates with club vibes, Accuraat believes in myriad pathways to sonic pleasure. Their selections dance with cerebral elegance, blending mathematical precision and pulsating beats. Yet, there's a profound understanding of when to ease the pulse, drifting into languid, introspective melodies, or igniting the air with infectious surges of joy and energy. While attempting to label their sound might be futile, if one ventures to describe, think: interesting techno, breakbeat, dub, drum n bass, juke, new school house, and those intellectually stimulating bangers.

When the UK's whimsical vibes beckon, or when there's a playful skip in their step, Accuraat transforms into 'Crisp Sandwich.' An ode to the simple delight of potato crisps nestled in a sandwich, it's a crunchy, budget-friendly thrill in every bite, or beat.
