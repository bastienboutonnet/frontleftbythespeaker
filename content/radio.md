I plan to do a deep dive into to my favourite 90s records; from prog, trance and all-round high energy bangers.

**About Just Chris:**
Chris is a living room DJ, popular almost exclusively among friends at afters. With a keen ear and knowledge of both the modern and the classics, he hopes to bring his crafted taste to the airwaves.
