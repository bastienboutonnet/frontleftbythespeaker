Shady Lady creeps around your house, trickling into your ears with floor filling treats and chunky beats. This Aussie DJ’s selection will make you remember the definition of dancing whether you like it or not.

**About Shady Lady:**
Shady Lady, a Sydney born and Amsterdam based DJ lays her heart out on the decks for all to see. With a background in theatre and performance her shows are heavily shameless and entertaining. Don’t be fooled by her presentation though; her knowledge of Queer and Black music history is forever present in her disco and house selection.
