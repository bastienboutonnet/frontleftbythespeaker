## Upcoming Show: Will Sharp (he/him) / April 10, 2024 / 6-7:30PM
{{< youtube id="cVoWRJg_F4U" autoplay="true">}}

Treating you to a variety of (mostly) 1989/early 90s house gems from Italy, New York, and Toronto, all dripping with pure nostalgic beauty - including a few of my favourite records and discoveries I've copped this year (so far).

**About Will Sharp:**

Heavily inspired by the sounds of various Italian clubs from back in the day, Will has an insatiable appetite for digging up forgotten early 90s underground house and downtempo gems, from the deep and ethereal to the euphoric and pumping.
