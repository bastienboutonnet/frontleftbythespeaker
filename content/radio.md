**About the Show**

Although I’ve been a sucker for fast breaks, deep bass and groovy vocals since my first raves, I’ve never taken the chance to craft a set around my love for jungle. Growing up in the south, I was lucky enough to experience the full energy of this genre blasting through the sound systems of Zinloos Geluid and was lucky enough to have the Planet Jungle crew bring Roni size to my small hometown. For this radio show I’ll set the record straight with some old favourites and new gems.

**About Stëfän Dänïëls:**

Stëfän Dänïëls is known for his visual work for the likes of Dektmantel, Fact Magazine, Tresor and Albert van Abbe, but for the past few years he’s bringing his creativity to the decks. With his Amsterdam based collective Etape, he’s dedicated to creating club experiences that bridge genres, cities and crowds with a touch of fun.
